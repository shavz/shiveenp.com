Hi and welcome to my site. 

My name is Shiveen and I like building great products.

Growing up, I've always been fascinated with how the world works, and the ability to write software allows me to creatively explore the world and leave it a little bit better.

In my spare time I love catching up on all things' astronomy, history and investment podcasts, and am an avid reader with my favourite genres being hard science fiction, psychology and modern history.

Outside of my programming and reading pursuits, my long term hobbies include hiking/camping, photography and boxing.
