👋 I'm Shiveen Pandita, and I currently live in Sydney. I write and blog about software, nature and life in general. I like to work on hard problems, build new products and nurture teams 🌱.

My day job is currently working on Jira Service Desk at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com). Previously I have worked at [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com), [Ordermentum](https://www.ordermentum.com) and [Grow Super](https://www.growsuper.com) focusing primarily on fintech, payments, security and reporting systems. I have experience in wide range of technologies writing backend and frontend solutions as well as leading teams of technical and product champions. 

Outside of my programming and reading pursuits, my other hobbies include hiking/camping, photography, and boxing.
