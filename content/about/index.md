Hi! My name is Shiveen 👋🏽 🤓 I like to travel, cook, read and develop software for humans.

![](/about_me.jpg)

Head [here](/resume) for my professional resume.

I like building software and products for companies that are making a difference. I have previously worked in finance @ [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) and lead the platform team for a large scale orders and payments system @ [Ordermentum](https://www.ordermentum.com/). Currently, working on making the retirement lives of average australian better by making [superannuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia) efficient @ [Grow Super](https://www.growsuper.com/).

Growing up, I've always been fascinated with how the world works, and the ability to write software as living allows me to explore all the creative possibilities I can think of to make someone's life better.

My current software development interest lies in Kotlin as a general purpose programming language to build scalable systems along with providing performance glue using Rust and building responsive front end systems using VueJs and Node.

In my spare time I love catching up on all things' astronomy 🌌 🚀, history and investment podcasts, and am an avid reader with my favourite genres being hard science fiction, psychology and autobiographical novels. 

Outside of my programming pursuits, my long term hobbies include camping 🏕, hiking 🥾, boxing 🥊 and landscape photography ⛰ 📷.

Here's a glimpse of tools I [use](/uses).
