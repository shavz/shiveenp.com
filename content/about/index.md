Hi! My name is Shiveen 👋🏽 🤓 

I like building software and products for companies that are making a difference. I am currently a Senior Engineer @ [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) working on the Jira family of products. I have previously worked in finance @ [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) and lead the platform team for a large scale orders and payments system @ [Ordermentum](https://www.ordermentum.com/) and most recently as Tech Lead @ [Grow Super](https://www.growsuper.com/) which is focussed on making a super admin platform. 

Growing up, I've always been fascinated with how the world works, and the ability to write software allows me to creatively explore the world and leave it a little bit better.

In my spare time I love catching up on all things' astronomy, history and investment podcasts, and am an avid reader with my favourite genres being hard science fiction, psychology and modern history.

Outside of my programming and reading pursuits, my long term hobbies include hiking/camping, photography and boxing.
