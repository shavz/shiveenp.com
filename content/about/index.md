👋 I'm Shiveen Pandita, and I currently live in Sydney. I write and blog about software, nature and life in general. I like to work on hard problems, build new products and nurture teams 🌱.

Currently, in my day job I am working on Jira Service Desk at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com). My previous stints include [Grow Super](https://www.growsuper.com), [Ordermentum](https://www.ordermentum.com) and [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com),  focusing primarily on fintech, payments, security and reporting systems. I have experience in wide range of technologies writing backend and frontend solutions as well as leading teams of technical and product champions. 

Outside of my programming and [reading pursuits](https://www.notion.so/shiveenp/084b9f6a8bba42c89e29564b32ce9569?v=6a38d11de89340478e086da1fde7a58a), my other hobbies include hiking/camping, photography, and boxing.
