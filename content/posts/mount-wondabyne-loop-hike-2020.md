The hike starts off near an overcrowded parking spot off [Woy Woy Road](https://goo.gl/maps/inCW59h5bWAoqPeD9). On the day we went (which was a Saturday) the spot was a bit overcrowded so might be worth going in early if nabbing a parking spot is important.

Past the closed gate, the hike starts on a gravel road that blends into a standard australian bush fire trail.  There is not much shade once you go on the firetrail but there are plenty of trees in case you want to rest and take in the nature or do some bird watching. There's also a small pond that filled with water when we visited and might make for a nice swimming spot in summer.

Once you've walked on the firetrail for almost a kilometer you're presented with another gate that forbids pet animals. Unlike some previous hikes where I have seen parks prevent pets from entering (due to having poison meant for other animals on the track), this one had a barricade because pets scare away the native fauna and then they don't reproduce ðŸ˜®. Since we didn't have any pets. we jumped the gate and made our way further in.

After a short walk the trail widens, and you're presented with a rocky path. The trail remains rocky past this point. After some short distance, you'll reach another junction on the trail where one part points towards the tunnel trail. According to my map we needed to go up this path so off we went. The trail starts gaining inclination past this point but nothing too crazy. The foliage is also denser in this area, and we saw quite a few birds, so the avid bird watchers might have a treat or two in store for them.

Eventually, we see the sign we were waiting for, and it directs us to Mt. Wondabyne (which is the highest point in the Brisbane waters national park). after a bit of walking and some narrow trail upwards, we reached the point where the hike to the summit starts. The hike itself is not that arduous but might be worth being careful of slippery rocks and some deceiving ledges. But with some light maneuvering we made it to the peak, and it was gorgeous with nice 360 deg. views, and we could even see some sailboats in the distance.

After spending some time there, and we descended and made our way back. All in all it was  avery pleasant hike, and I would definitely recommend it.
