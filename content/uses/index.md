Inspired by [others](https://uses.tech), this is just a broad overview of my setup and productivity tools. I aim to keep this list updated and any major changes would be crossed out with reasoning.

I develop primarily in Kotlin and VueJs, but also dabble in Rust and Swift.

### Hardware

{{< figure src="/screenfetch_screenshot.png" alt="Mac OS specs Image" >}}

- [Macbook Pro 13"](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook-pro-13/): I have used windows, linux and Mac both professionally and as a hobbyist. Although I was on Ubuntu for a couple of years, nothing beats the general ease of use and dev friendliness of a Mac.
- [Dell Ultrasharp 32" 4K Monitor](https://www.amazon.com.au/32-Inch-Screen-LED-Lit-Monitor-U3219Q/dp/B07HDBD9CM): I use a 4K monitor at home to do all my dev and creative (photo editing) work
- [Logitech MX Master 2](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/mx-master-2)
- [Keychron K2 Mechanical Keyboard with Brown Switches](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-mechanical-keyboard?variant=31063869653081)
- [iPhone 11 Pro](https://www.apple.com/au/iphone-11-pro/)

## Software

I have only listed main highlights here. For a more comprehensive listing - my dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/shavz/dotfiles). Feel free to copy anything you find interesting, as I have done from so many other amazing people out there.

### Development Tools

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) as my main terminal with [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) IDE of choice for both back and front end work
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my general text editor amd for days when IDEA indexing is being especially annoying, and I need to get work done
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) as my main driver for working with Postgres, which is the database I most encounter in professional and personal setting
- [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) for deploy my apps
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for static hosting (like this blog), I really like their developer experience and the nifty hidden features
- Safari as my daily driver for general web usage and personal dev. I keep Chrome around for dev tooling.
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) for tetsing APIs and building shareable api collections for my projects
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) for days when cli git just won't cut it
- [RunCat](https://kyome.io/runcat/index.html)
- [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) as my programming font since it works well with the stack I use

### Apps 

- [1Password](https://1password.com) for managing my logins and passwords - their family plans has been especially useful
- A combination [Bear](https://bear.app) for quick note taking and [Notion](https://www.notion.so) as my knowledge colosseum
- [Alfred 4](https://www.alfredapp.com/) probably the most used app in my toolkit, saves me so much time
- [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) as my main GTD app. Also hands down the best app I own across all my devices
- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) as my mac calendar replacement, this app is worth every penny and makes integrating with my scheduling service (Gcal, Zoom etc) a breeze.
- [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/au/apple-music/) for music. I migrated away from Spotify after 6 years of using them since I find the apple music interface better. However, they're both great choices in my opinion.
