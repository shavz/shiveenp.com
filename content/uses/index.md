Inspired by [others](https://uses.tech), this is just a broad overview of my setup and productivity tools. The list isn't exhaustive and only contains tools that are directly related to my work or daily productivity stack. I aim to keep this list updated and any major changes would be crossed out with reasoning.

I develop primarily in Kotlin and VueJs, but also dabble in Rust and Swift. You can see some photos of my current setup [here](https://twitter.com/shavzer/status/1284743197738991616).

### Hardware

- **MacBook Pro 16"** (for work) ðŸ¤‘
    - 2.4GHz 8 core
    - 32GB DDR4 RAM
    - AMD Radeon Pro with 4GB DDR6 memory
    - 2 TB SSD
 
- **MacBook Pro 13"** (for personal use) ðŸ˜”
    - 2.3 GHz 2 core
    - 16 GB DDR3 RAM
    - 512 GB SSD

- **Dell U2720Q**: This monitor is the perfect size for me. Having tried both a larger (32") and an UltraWide monitors in the past, I find 27" to be the sweetspot when it comes to screen real estate and neck movement rquired when working.
- **Apple Trackpad 2**
- **Logitech MX Master 2**
- **Keychron K2 Mechanical Keyboard** (hot tip: this keyboard is high and can be clicky even with brown switches, so investing in a palm rest and some O-rings will go a long way)
- **Logitech C922 Pro Webcam**
- **iPhone 11 Pro**

## Software

I have only listed main highlights here. For a more comprehensive listing - my dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/shavz/dotfiles). Feel free to copy anything you find interesting, as I have done from so many other amazing people out there.

### Development Tools

- **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate** as my beast of choice for both back and front end work. 
- **iTerm2**  with [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and Powerline10k theme.
- **Sublime Text** for general text editing needs
- **Postico** for developing in my primary database, postgres
- **AWS Lightsail** for deploying my hobby servers and **Netlify** for static site hosting
- **Safari** as my daily driver for general web usage and personal dev. I keep **Chrome** around for dev tooling.
- **Jetbrains Mono** as my programming font and coupled with **Dracula** theme everywhere to keep the ecperience consistent
- **Postman** for API testing
- **Monodraw** for some nice looking ASCII diagrams
- **ImageOptim** for when I need to optimize images for web and bandwidth constrained mediums

### Mac Apps 

- **1Password** for managing my logins and passwords. I have a family plan that my partner, and I use religiously
- **Spark** for email
- ~~Bear as my note and wiki app. I love how it gets out of my way and lets me focus on just writing. I have tried various other alternatives like Notion, Apple Notes, OneNote etc but keep coming back to Bear and will probably stick with it for a long time now.~~ After the recent **Notion** update, and them offering free plans with minimal limits,  I'm slowly moving my notes and wiki over and so far loving the improvements they have done in the experience since I last tried it.
- **Alfred 4** probably the most used app in my toolkit, saves me so much time
- **Things 3** as my main GTD app. Also hands down the best app I own across all my devices
- **Reeder4** for consuming my news sources. My normal integrations include feedly, and my safari readit it later queue
- **StepTwo Authenticator** as my TOTP store. I really like the nice interface and native iCloud sync
- **Apple Music** for music streaming. I migrated away from Spotify after 6 years of using them since I find the apple music interface better. However, they're both great choices in my opinion.
- **RescueTime** for tracking my time sinks and getting nice summaries of my daily online activity
- **Magnet** for managing workspace and multitasking between windows
- **Dato** as my new replacement for ItsyCal

### iOS Apps

- **Spark Mail** and **Calendar5** for mail and scheduling
- **Darkroom** for photo editing
- **Apollo** for Reddit
- **Apple health** for daily workout tracking and other nifty metrics
- Long time user of **Pocket Casts** for podcasts
- **Slack** and **Discord** for work and personal group chats

### Chrome Extensions
- **1PasswordX**
- **uBlock Origin**
- **Vue DevTools**
- **React DevTools**
- **Reddit Enhancement Suite**
- **CSS Peeper**
- **JsonView**
