Inspired by [others](https://uses.tech), this is just a broad overview of my setup and productivity tools. The list isn't exhaustive and only contains tools that are directly related to my work or daily productivity stack. I aim to keep this list updated and any major changes would be crossed out with reasoning.

I develop primarily in Kotlin and VueJs, but also dabble in Rust and Swift.

### Hardware

{{< figure src="/setup.jpeg" alt="Mac OS specs Image" >}}

- Macbook Pro 13 inch at home and Macbook Pro 16 inch for work : I have used windows, linux and Mac both professionally and as a hobbyist. Although I was on Ubuntu for a couple of years, and developed primarily in windows for work in the past - nothing beats the general ease of use and dev friendliness of a Mac.
- [Dell Ultrasharp 27" USB-C Monitor](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-usb-c-monitor-u2719dc/apd/210-arcz/monitors-monitor-accessories): This monitor is the perfect size for me. Having tried both a larger (32") and an UltraWide monitors in the past, I find 27" to be the sweetspot when it comes to screen real estate and neck movement rquired when working.
- Apple Trackpad
- Logitech MX Master 2
- Keychron K2 Mechanical Keyboard with Brown Switches: I like the keyless profile and satsifying keypress. However, this keyboard is definitely loud even with less clicky switches and had to get O-ring dampeners. 
- Logitech C922 Pro Webcam
- iPhone 11 Pro

## Software

I have only listed main highlights here. For a more comprehensive listing - my dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/shavz/dotfiles). Feel free to copy anything you find interesting, as I have done from so many other amazing people out there.

### Development Tools

- iTerm2  with [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate: IDE of choice for both back and front end work
- Sublime Text for general text editing needs
- Postico for developing in my primary database, postgres
- AWS Lightsail for deploying my hobby apps and Netlify for static site hosting
- Safari as my daily driver for general web usage and personal dev. I keep Chrome around for dev tooling.
- Jetbrains Mono as my programming font since it works well with the stack I use

### Mac Apps 

- 1Password for managing my logins and passwords. I have a family plan that my partner and I use releigiously
- Bear as my note and wiki app. I love how it gets out of my way and lets me focus on just writing. I have tried various other alternatives like Notion, Apple Notes, OneNote etc but keep coming back to Bear and will probably stick with it for a long time now.
- Alfred 4: probably the most used app in my toolkit, saves me so much time
- Things 3 as my main GTD app. Also hands down the best app I own across all my devices
- Pocket for aggregating random links I find interesting over the interwebs
- Reeder for consuming my news sources. My normal integrations include feedly, pocket and my safari readt it later queue
- StepTwo Authenticator as my TOTP store. I really like the nice interface and native iCloud sync
- Apple Music for music streaming. I migrated away from Spotify after 6 years of using them since I find the apple music interface better. However, they're both great choices in my opinion.

### iOS Apps

- Apple Mail and Apple Calendar for mail and scheduling
- Darkroom for photo editing
- Appollo for Reddit
- Apple health for daily workout tracking and other nifty metrics
- Pocket Casts for podcasts
- Slack and Discord for work and personal group chats

### Other Accessories

- Yubikey 5ci
- iPad Air
- Apple Pencil
- Airpods Pro and Bose QC35 II to allow me to focus and work from home confortably. I generally use Airpods Pro as a daily workhorse and onlt use the Bose when travelling or while the Airpods are charging.
- Keychron Palm Rest
- Satechi Desk Mat
- Bestand Laptop Stand
- IKEA SIGFINN Monitor Riser
- Bellroy Studio Backpack
